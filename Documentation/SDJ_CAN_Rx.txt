Module "CAN1"      (component FreescaleCAN)
   - CAN1_SendFrame -Sends the frame via the CAN device. Using this method the user can send own message to the CAN bus. This 
                method allows to specify CAN buffer number, message ID, data to be sent and frame type 
                (DATA_FRAME/REMOTE_FRAME).
   - CAN1_ReadFrame -Reads a frame from the CAN device. The user is informed about CAN reception through OnFullRxBuffer event 
                or GetStateRX method.

Module "TI1"       (component TimerInt)

Module "PWM1"      (component PWM)
   - PWM1_SetRatio16 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as a 16-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - FFFF 
                value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined 
                values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer possibilities and on 
                the selected period.
   - PWM1_SetDutyUS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in microseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.
   - PWM1_SetDutyMS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in milliseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.

Module "PWM2"      (component PWM)
   - PWM2_SetRatio16 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as a 16-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - FFFF 
                value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined 
                values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer possibilities and on 
                the selected period.
   - PWM2_SetDutyUS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in microseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.
   - PWM2_SetDutyMS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in milliseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.

Module "Cap1"      (component Capture)
   - Cap1_Reset -This method resets the counter register (see implementation note in <General Info>).
   - Cap1_GetCaptureValue -This method gets the last value captured by enabled timer (see implementation note in <General Info>)
                . The method does not return valid value after initialization or after <Reset> until new capture event (even if 
                the returned Error code is ERR_OK).

Module "Cap2"      (component Capture)
   - Cap2_Reset -This method resets the counter register (see implementation note in <General Info>).
   - Cap2_GetCaptureValue -This method gets the last value captured by enabled timer (see implementation note in <General Info>)
                . The method does not return valid value after initialization or after <Reset> until new capture event (even if 
                the returned Error code is ERR_OK).

Module "Cap3"      (component Capture)
   - Cap3_Reset -This method resets the counter register (see implementation note in <General Info>).
   - Cap3_GetCaptureValue -This method gets the last value captured by enabled timer (see implementation note in <General Info>)
                . The method does not return valid value after initialization or after <Reset> until new capture event (even if 
                the returned Error code is ERR_OK).

Module "Cap1Pin"   (component InputPin)
   - Cap1Pin_GetVal -Return the value on the pin.

Module "Cap2Pin"   (component InputPin)
   - Cap2Pin_GetVal -Return the value on the pin.

Module "Cap3Pin"   (component InputPin)
   - Cap3Pin_GetVal -Return the value on the pin.

Module "Cpu"       (component MC9S12ZVCA192_48)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_SetWaitMode -Set low power mode - Wait mode.   For more information about the wait mode see documentation of this CPU. 
                Release from Wait mode: Reset or interrupt
   - Cpu_SetStopMode -Set low power mode - Stop mode.   For more information about the stop mode see documentation of this CPU.
